# Flexbox-Company-Website

- A mock flexbox responsive website
- Implemented many features that will be used in the final OTS landing page (personal project)
- Javascript implemented for Nav Bar hamburger menu
- @media queries used
- Very promising responsive nav bar template, could be used for other future projects
- Forgive the images, the idea was to showcase the working automatic slide
- Not to be taken seriously. My son loves it :)
